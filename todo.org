correctly position the  matching "}", and move the cursor inside the block. Toggleable. []

keep a list of opened files to quickly
go to the previous or next "buffer" or kill them [x]
mismatched cut and selection [x]

Editor_new_line_down and up should mantain indentation [x]
yasnippet [x] TODO
when copying with y do it like vim[x]
evil join on shift + j [x]
Emacs mode [x]
Togglable visibility of whitespaces[x]
different cursor color based on the mode[x]
if editor->has_mark make the cursor trasparent [x]

* Shaders
use shaders from =~/.config/ded/shaders= instead [x]
* Lexer
support multi line tokens []
chech for strings in arrays []
multi line comments []
different vertex and fragment shader per token (need batch rendering) []
different font per token []
'' [x]
NULL [x]
syntax highlighting for : | || & && [x]
highlight links [x]
* Renderer 
batch rendering []
optional vscode hl_line []
cchange hl_line color based on mode []
render_trailing_whitespaces []
line under links []
render circles (we need to use a shader for better performance) [/]

* Theme
each theme should have a name not only and index
* Evil
evil-find-char-backward []
evil-visual-line-mode []
evil-search-backward []
splits(maybe)   []
5k should work []
